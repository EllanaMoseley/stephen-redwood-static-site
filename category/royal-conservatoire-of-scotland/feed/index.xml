										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Yep it&#8217;s an opening night selfie from onstage. There&#8217;s an audience sitting just out of shot. We are supposed to do it, honest! As a passerby on Waterloo Bridge, Director Mark Thomson commenting on the rise of filming terrible events as a first reaction. This scene is when Freya is about to jump off and the passerbys film what&#8217;s going on and heckle her. I hope this is the worst of humanity depicted, but some members of the cast dos recount experiences where they had witnessed the same thing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Seeing as I&#8217;m writing this on my mobile, I&#8217;m feeling slightly guilty for my addiction to my phone, but I&#8217;m pretty sure I wouldn&#8217;t film a suicidal woman. Still, it can be interesting to imagine what kind of disconnect or justification would lead someone to do that.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Earthquakes rehearsals started today. I&#8217;ve got the usual jitters of starting rehearsals. It&#8217;s like eating loads of chocolate the night before and not being able to sleep, kind of Christmas Day excitement.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is a complicated show! There&#8217;s something like seventy characters and most of us are swapping and changing all over the place. Not only that, there&#8217;s loads of locations as well, so it&#8217;s using a moving van&#8217;s worth of furniture.</p>
<p>Director Mark Thomson (of the Edinburgh Lyceum &#8211; no pressure!) is being reassuring over the sheer enormity of &#8216;the beast&#8217;, and I&#8217;m sure we&#8217;ll pull off a fantastic show.</p>
<p>Mike Bartlett&#8217;s <em>Earthquakes in London</em> was originally a site specific show where the audience walked to each of the locations, before it moved into the Lyttelton Theatre at the National. And as we&#8217;re discovering, it has some hard hitting observations about climate change, the murkiness of politics, and Bartlett&#8217;s understanding of people not quite connecting to each other in their bid to survive.&nbsp;<a href="/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/IMG_2067.jpg"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/IMG_2067.jpg" alt=""></a>&nbsp;The show goes up in June at the Tron Theatre in Glasgow, before moving all the way down South to the Cockpit Theatre in London. Thinking about it, that could be considered my first tour!</p>

I&#8217;ve been getting to sing and dance my heart out &#8211; you can see the guys as &#8216;No Direction &#8211; Scotlands Most Unknown Boyband&#8217;, and just have a great time.&nbsp;It&#8217;s been an absolute joy watching so many children, with often their first experience of theatre, have such a great time &#8211; easily the most thrilling part of it all.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I have finished working on Kidnapped with Graham McLaren, a exploratory harness flying show. It has been a rollercoaster of an experience. Not least, the twice daily workouts, warm-ups and stretching sessions, and then somehow creating a high-octane show full of stunts and spectacle. I have more muscle than usual, and far more physicality than I would usually have. It’s been the experience of a lifetime, and I’ve been so privileged to be able to take part and work with all the technical crew, Vicki Manderson and Graham. My fingers are crossed that I can do it again sometime!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So I&#8217;ve just finished <em>A Midsummer Night&#8217;s Dream</em> at the Royal Conservatoire of Scotland and had a wonderful time playing Snug the Joiner, who dresses up as a Lion for a little play within the play.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.crimsonphoenix.co/Stephen%20Redwood_Snug_Lion_Kirstin_Rodger.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>This costume was designed and made by the exceptional Kirstin Rogers, who was the designer for the show. It was directed by Ali Da Souza, and Katy Hale was the Assistant Director. I really enjoyed working with them, although I only had about a four days of rehearsal, as I was busy working on another show at the same time!</p>
<p>You can find the Herald&#8217;s review of the show <a href="https://http//www.heraldscotland.com/arts-ents/stage/live-review-a-midsummer-nights-dream-at-the-royal-conservatoire-of-scotland.115984167">here</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Tonight marks the end of <em>The Country Wife</em>, a Restoration comedy which Director James Robert Carson carefully updated. It has been a wonderful experience to work with the 2015 Graduating Company, and I have enjoyed the production immensely. You can see me above in my costume above, along with members of the cast. The show has been very successful, with audiences laughing their way through the two acts since Tuesday evening. The Herald posted a five star review and glowing praise for many of the actors including Lorne MacFadyen who is &#8220;one to watch&#8221; and Connie Hartley who was &#8220;enchanting&#8221;. The whole review can be found <a href="https://www.heraldscotland.com/arts-ents/stage/review-theatre.25791991">here</a>. Many thanks to everyone who has made this production happen. I have made some fantastic new friends, and I can&#8217;t wait to see how the rest of your careers turn out.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a promotional shot taken by Ken Dundas.</p>
