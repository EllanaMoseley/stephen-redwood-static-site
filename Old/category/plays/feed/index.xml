This is a beautiful children’s story about a toy rabbit who yearns to become real to the child that plays with him. </p>
<p>Based on Margery William’s novel and featuring the talents of Seona McClintock, whose genius idea it was, leading a team consisting of myself, Beth Frieden, Janis Marshall-Reilly and Julie Tsang.</p>
</div></div></div></div><div id="x-section-2" class="x-section" style="margin: 0px;padding: 45px 0px 0px; background-color: transparent;" ><div id="" class="x-container max width" style="margin: 0px auto;padding: 0px;" ><div  class="x-column x-sm x-1-1" style="padding: 0px;" ><div id="" class="x-text" style="" ><p>With some exciting use of physical theatre, the puppet rabbit transforms into a real rabbit &#8211; a lot of animal study work for me, trying to emulate both a rabbit slightly more real than a puppet, and still have a puppet like movement, even though I&#8217;m very much not a puppet!</p>
<p>These lovely photos are all taken by <a href="http://www.robinmitchellphotography.com/">Robin Mitchell</a>.  You can find out more about his photography at the link, and if you&#8217;re a theatre person, you can hire him to take photos of your show.</p>

It’s something that I simply wasn’t taught at drama school, although it uses similar principles to a lot of movement work that we did thankfully, so it wasn’t too hard to master. I’ve actually really enjoyed working with puppets and I am hopeful after my time at the Tron, I will be able to do more work with puppetry in shows. I’m considering using it in some of the shows I create as well. It’s a very versatile form, allowing you to present magical things in a metaphorical way that naturalism sometimes struggles with.</p>

Rippling was a haunting portrayal of a woman yearning for the human contact of the big cities, compared to the isolation of her island home. Daisy Jo Lucas&#8217;s retreat was a comedic treat in a yogic, detox retreat full of people who needed the calm and silence, but weren&#8217;t terribly open to it, and Isla Robertson&#8217;s Coffin Race was an incredibly exciting blurring of genres with a staged radio play brought to life with a cast of people adding all sorts of exciting sound effects.<br />

Having seen all the shows on Kansas day, I can say that they were an absolute treat. </li></ul></div></div></div></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Yep it&#8217;s an opening night selfie from onstage. There&#8217;s an audience sitting just out of shot. We are supposed to do it, honest! As a passerby on Waterloo Bridge, Director Mark Thomson commenting on the rise of filming terrible events as a first reaction. This scene is when Freya is about to jump off and the passerbys film what&#8217;s going on and heckle her. I hope this is the worst of humanity depicted, but some members of the cast dos recount experiences where they had witnessed the same thing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Seeing as I&#8217;m writing this on my mobile, I&#8217;m feeling slightly guilty for my addiction to my phone, but I&#8217;m pretty sure I wouldn&#8217;t film a suicidal woman. Still, it can be interesting to imagine what kind of disconnect or justification would lead someone to do that.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Earthquakes rehearsals started today. I&#8217;ve got the usual jitters of starting rehearsals. It&#8217;s like eating loads of chocolate the night before and not being able to sleep, kind of Christmas Day excitement.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is a complicated show! There&#8217;s something like seventy characters and most of us are swapping and changing all over the place. Not only that, there&#8217;s loads of locations as well, so it&#8217;s using a moving van&#8217;s worth of furniture.</p>
<p>Director Mark Thomson (of the Edinburgh Lyceum &#8211; no pressure!) is being reassuring over the sheer enormity of &#8216;the beast&#8217;, and I&#8217;m sure we&#8217;ll pull off a fantastic show.</p>
<p>Mike Bartlett&#8217;s <em>Earthquakes in London</em> was originally a site specific show where the audience walked to each of the locations, before it moved into the Lyttelton Theatre at the National. And as we&#8217;re discovering, it has some hard hitting observations about climate change, the murkiness of politics, and Bartlett&#8217;s understanding of people not quite connecting to each other in their bid to survive.&nbsp;<a href="/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/IMG_2067.jpg"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/IMG_2067.jpg" alt=""></a>&nbsp;The show goes up in June at the Tron Theatre in Glasgow, before moving all the way down South to the Cockpit Theatre in London. Thinking about it, that could be considered my first tour!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I have finished working on Kidnapped with Graham McLaren, a exploratory harness flying show. It has been a rollercoaster of an experience. Not least, the twice daily workouts, warm-ups and stretching sessions, and then somehow creating a high-octane show full of stunts and spectacle. I have more muscle than usual, and far more physicality than I would usually have. It’s been the experience of a lifetime, and I’ve been so privileged to be able to take part and work with all the technical crew, Vicki Manderson and Graham. My fingers are crossed that I can do it again sometime!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I have just finished working on BC, a play by Nazlah Black, that we workshopped and performed in the On The Verge new writing festival at The Arches in Glasgow &#8211; On The Verge is part of the BA Acting that I am currently studying on, at the Royal Conservatoire of Scotland, and is an opportunity for students to create their own work. There were some really wonderful pieces that I really hope go further, as they have so much potential and it was great to see a week of plays, and up to three or four new plays a day.</p>
<p>For us, after weeks working in a rehearsal room on text and story construction; acting and improvising the scenes again and again to really get to grips with the essence of the work, we came out with a play. I worked with Vivan Chan and Laurence Scott, two of my fellow actors at the Royal Conservatoire of Scotland on the work that tells the story of two teenagers, one of whom is battling depression. A tough subject that really required its research and a strong assertion of artistic integrity. It is not a subject to be played with lightly, but hopefully we explored it touchingly and honestly. It was an eye-opening experience to work on new contemporary writing as an actor and one I shall never forget. I guess it will make more sense in the context of the play than at the end of my post, but I think it&#8217;s a beautiful line from the show so I&#8217;m gonna put it in anyway. As Dani (played by the lovely Vivian Chan) says in the play, &#8220;Some memories are harder to erase than others&#8221;.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I have just finished <em>A Midsummer Night&#8217;s Dream</em> with the BBC Scottish Symphony Orchestra, a concert featuring Mendelssohn&#8217;s music that he started at 17. (He wrote the overture at that age anyway!). <img loading="lazy" class=" size-thumbnail wp-image-112 alignright" src="http://www.crimsonphoenix.co/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/IMG_1205-150x150.jpg" alt="IMG_1205" width="150" height="150" />I was playing Puck and the words, while Shakespeare&#8217;s, were in a version by Gerard McBurney. It went out live on BBC Radio 3 which was terrifying as a thought, but I forgot about the terror once I was on the stage.  We performed to people in the City Halls where the SSO is based. It was absolutely thrilling to hear the orchestra. We had been told in between our sections of acting to turn and look awed by the orchestra. One time when none of us had to act I can tell you.</p>
<blockquote>
<div id="attachment_113" style="width: 160px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="http://www.crimsonphoenix.co/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/IMG_1204.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-113" loading="lazy" class="size-thumbnail wp-image-113" src="http://www.crimsonphoenix.co/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/IMG_1204-150x150.jpg" alt="Puck in A Midsummer Night's Dream" width="150" height="150" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-113" class="wp-caption-text">Puck in A Midsummer Night&#8217;s Dream</p></div></blockquote>
<p>Something like 70 musicians playing at the same time is a simply awe-inspiring sight, and a complete feast for anyone&#8217;s ears. The players of the SSO were incredibly wonderful to work with, and Marcus Stenz (the conductor) was so supportive of our performance. And our Director, Jennifer Dick, made sure we didn&#8217;t lose our heads over the sheer enormity of undertaking such an incredible opportunity.</p>

We&#8217;ll be performing at City Halls with the orchestra, who sound phenomenal in the other concerts that we&#8217;ve seen. See the poster above for a taste of the show, and if you can, catch myself and my friends on BBC radio or make it down to City Halls in Glasgow.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;ve just finished a run of <em>As You Like It</em> by William Shakespeare, here at the Royal Conservatoire of Scotland, which went really well. I played Le Beau, Amiens and William, as well as a goat and a sheep. (I&#8217;m getting a reputation for playing animals, I know!)</p>
<p>It was directed by Peter Collins, designed by Kirstin Rodger and John Kazek was Assistant Director.</p>
<p>It was a great show, although it was in the round so I had to really work on diction and projection exercises as a warm up.</p>
<p>You can find the <a href="https://http//www.heraldscotland.com/arts-ents/stage/live-review-as-you-like-it-at-royal-conservatoire-of-scotland-glasgow.116932133">Herald review here.</a> My friend Conor gets a mention as a &#8220;fine figure&#8221;, as does Charlotte as Rosalind and Colleen as a sheep! My personal quote of the week, &#8220;The ensemble cast was without a weak link&#8221; which is fine praise for the rest of the company.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So I&#8217;ve just finished <em>A Midsummer Night&#8217;s Dream</em> at the Royal Conservatoire of Scotland and had a wonderful time playing Snug the Joiner, who dresses up as a Lion for a little play within the play.</p>

<p>This costume was designed and made by the exceptional Kirstin Rogers, who was the designer for the show. It was directed by Ali Da Souza, and Katy Hale was the Assistant Director. I really enjoyed working with them, although I only had about a four days of rehearsal, as I was busy working on another show at the same time!</p>
<p>You can find the Herald&#8217;s review of the show <a href="https://http//www.heraldscotland.com/arts-ents/stage/live-review-a-midsummer-nights-dream-at-the-royal-conservatoire-of-scotland.115984167">here</a>.</p>
