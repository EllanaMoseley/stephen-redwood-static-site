										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;ve been working on a new musical (it&#8217;s a secret!!!) with <a href="https://www.ellandarproductions.com/">Ellandar productions</a>. A development day of pure pleasure as we improvised musical numbers, played with text and character, worked with themes and scene ideas. Just a fun filled day of exploration &#8211; one of the joys of working in the arts.</p>
<p>Iskandar was leading us all as director, and the piece is going to have some more development later in the year. I&#8217;m really excited to be a part of this project and I can&#8217;t wait to see where it will go.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I have been filming on my first night shoot for Night&#8217;s Dream with Velocity Films. Playing the marvellously vindictive Puck in an original reinterpretation of <i>A Midsummer Night&#8217;s Dream. </i>You can see a picture above. Obviously it&#8217;s raining, hence the particularly attractive bright pink umbrella.</p>
<p>You have not been a proper actor until you have had to squelch through mud, stand in a rainstorm, or crouch in the freezing dark waiting to maim, stab or perform some sort of dangerous mock killing move on camera. Ain&#8217;t nothing like a serial killer to get your actor creativity flowing!&nbsp;</p>
<p>In this, Puck is a dangerous and flamboyant bad guy, with an ambitious yearning to be the top dog. And apparently, as discussed by the crew, bad guys are my thing.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not sure what that says about me&#8230;</p>
<p>Never judge an actor by his parts. </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Took a project to the fringe this week. I was playing Jack, a world war 1 soldier in a musical about women spies. The audience seemed really positive about the work and we got great comments about the story, and the music, even if our reviews weren&#8217;t as kind. Having given the show this road test in front of an audience made up primarily of people we don&#8217;t know, we&#8217;re able to make changes and refine it, and bring it back better than ever. Plus it was a load of fun to do. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/1f609.png" alt="ðŸ˜‰" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I am in the final few days of rehearsal at Bard In The Botanics for <i>The Merchant of Venice</i>&nbsp;in which I am playing Launcelot Gobbo and Salerio! I&#8217;m having a great time working on my first professional production and having my first experience of outdoor theatre. Filling the space is a challenge, it&#8217;s massive after all. Not a little theatre but a park, and making sure everyone can hear is a top priority. Then there&#8217;s Shakespeare and his language to get to grips with, and for your mouth around. After all, he&#8217;s the King of incredibly wordy sentences. But it&#8217;s an exciting challenge and I&#8217;m loving working on it with all my fellow actors. It opens on Thursday, and is directed by Gordon Barr, the Artistic Director of the Bard in The Botanics.&nbsp;<br />
