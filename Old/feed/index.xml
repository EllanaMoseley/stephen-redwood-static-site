This is a beautiful children’s story about a toy rabbit who yearns to become real to the child that plays with him. </p>
<p>Based on Margery William’s novel and featuring the talents of Seona McClintock, whose genius idea it was, leading a team consisting of myself, Beth Frieden, Janis Marshall-Reilly and Julie Tsang.</p>
</div></div></div></div><div id="x-section-2" class="x-section" style="margin: 0px;padding: 45px 0px 0px; background-color: transparent;" ><div id="" class="x-container max width" style="margin: 0px auto;padding: 0px;" ><div  class="x-column x-sm x-1-1" style="padding: 0px;" ><div id="" class="x-text" style="" ><p>With some exciting use of physical theatre, the puppet rabbit transforms into a real rabbit &#8211; a lot of animal study work for me, trying to emulate both a rabbit slightly more real than a puppet, and still have a puppet like movement, even though I&#8217;m very much not a puppet!</p>
<p>These lovely photos are all taken by <a href="http://www.robinmitchellphotography.com/">Robin Mitchell</a>.  You can find out more about his photography at the link, and if you&#8217;re a theatre person, you can hire him to take photos of your show.</p>
</div></div></div></div><div id="x-section-3" class="x-section" style="margin: 0px;padding: 45px 0px 0px; background-color: transparent;" ><div id="" class="x-container max width" style="margin: 0px auto;padding: 0px;" ><div  class="x-column x-sm x-1-3" style="padding: 0px;" ><img  class="x-img x-img-none"  src="/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/VelveteenRabbit_Tron100Festival2017_photo©RobinMitchell_081-Edit.jpg" ><img  class="x-img x-img-none"  src="/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/VelveteenRabbit_Tron100Festival2017_photo©RobinMitchell_078-Edit.jpg" ><img  class="x-img x-img-none"  src="/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/VelveteenRabbit_Tron100Festival2017_photo©RobinMitchell_097.jpg" ></div><div  class="x-column x-sm x-2-3" style="padding: 0px;" ><div id="" class="x-text" style="" ><p>The Rabbit himself is animated using rod puppetry, the same kind that’s used in a lot of shows in the West End, and theatres across the UK, from shows such as <em>Avenue Q</em> to <em>The Lion King</em>. It’s something that I simply wasn’t taught at drama school, although it uses similar principles to a lot of movement work that we did thankfully, so it wasn’t too hard to master. I’ve actually really enjoyed working with puppets and I am hopeful after my time at the Tron, I will be able to do more work with puppetry in shows. I’m considering using it in some of the shows I create as well. It’s a very versatile form, allowing you to present magical things in a metaphorical way that naturalism sometimes struggles with.</p>

Rippling was a haunting portrayal of a woman yearning for the human contact of the big cities, compared to the isolation of her island home. Daisy Jo Lucas&#8217;s retreat was a comedic treat in a yogic, detox retreat full of people who needed the calm and silence, but weren&#8217;t terribly open to it, and Isla Robertson&#8217;s Coffin Race was an incredibly exciting blurring of genres with a staged radio play brought to life with a cast of people adding all sorts of exciting sound effects.<br />

Having seen all the shows on Kansas day, I can say that they were an absolute treat. </li></ul></div></div></div></div>

Just a fun filled day of exploration &#8211; one of the joys of working in the arts.</p>
<p>Iskandar was leading us all as director, and the piece is going to have some more development later in the year. I&#8217;m really excited to be a part of this project and I can&#8217;t wait to see where it will go.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;ve been directing a little one person piece these last few weeks, starring the lovely<a href="https://www.victoriachen.co.uk/"> Victoria Chen</a>. <i>Charlie</i> explores the meeting between an audience member (that&#8217;s you lucky people) and a young girl who has never left the building. With no concept of the outside world, you have to help her understand and process the reality of the world around her. Good luck!</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_2710-0.png"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_2710-0.png" alt="" /></a><br />
It&#8217;s really exciting to be working on such an intimate piece, and I can&#8217;t wait for people to experience it.  Vic is an amazing actress who&#8217;s great to work with; extremely dedicated and talented.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s taking place at the Scottish Storytelling Centre in Edinburgh Feb 10th, 11th and 12th and produced by Mohamed Shaifulbahri of the <a href="http://www.bhumicollective.com/bhumi">Bhumi Collective</a>. Hopefully I&#8217;ll see you there!</p>
<p>UPDATE! 20/2/2017<br />
We&#8217;ve been nominated for the Best Performance Award. Fingers crossed, although I&#8217;m sure there are loads of amazing pieces up for it as well.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>UPDATE! 17/3/2017<br />
We won the Best Performance award! Literally so proud of Vic and all the hard work she put in.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Yep it&#8217;s an opening night selfie from onstage. There&#8217;s an audience sitting just out of shot. We are supposed to do it, honest! As a passerby on Waterloo Bridge, Director Mark Thomson commenting on the rise of filming terrible events as a first reaction. This scene is when Freya is about to jump off and the passerbys film what&#8217;s going on and heckle her. I hope this is the worst of humanity depicted, but some members of the cast dos recount experiences where they had witnessed the same thing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Seeing as I&#8217;m writing this on my mobile, I&#8217;m feeling slightly guilty for my addiction to my phone, but I&#8217;m pretty sure I wouldn&#8217;t film a suicidal woman. Still, it can be interesting to imagine what kind of disconnect or justification would lead someone to do that.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Earthquakes rehearsals started today. I&#8217;ve got the usual jitters of starting rehearsals. It&#8217;s like eating loads of chocolate the night before and not being able to sleep, kind of Christmas Day excitement.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is a complicated show! There&#8217;s something like seventy characters and most of us are swapping and changing all over the place. Not only that, there&#8217;s loads of locations as well, so it&#8217;s using a moving van&#8217;s worth of furniture.</p>
<p>Director Mark Thomson (of the Edinburgh Lyceum &#8211; no pressure!) is being reassuring over the sheer enormity of &#8216;the beast&#8217;, and I&#8217;m sure we&#8217;ll pull off a fantastic show.</p>
<p>Mike Bartlett&#8217;s <em>Earthquakes in London</em> was originally a site specific show where the audience walked to each of the locations, before it moved into the Lyttelton Theatre at the National. And as we&#8217;re discovering, it has some hard hitting observations about climate change, the murkiness of politics, and Bartlett&#8217;s understanding of people not quite connecting to each other in their bid to survive.&nbsp;<a href="/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/IMG_2067.jpg"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/IMG_2067.jpg" alt=""></a>&nbsp;The show goes up in June at the Tron Theatre in Glasgow, before moving all the way down South to the Cockpit Theatre in London. Thinking about it, that could be considered my first tour!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;ve had the pleasure of working on Reaper, the DFTV graduation film written and directed by the lovely Amber Simpson.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s being premiered in a cinema (I am so nervous you would not believe!) and filming went really well.</p>
<p>The hardest thing about film is handing over to the director. As a film actor, you hardly ever see your takes. You have to trust that your preparation is coming across, and that the director will tell you when your work needs improvement.</p>
<p>I also had the opportunity to work with the amazing Daniel Portman. (GoT) There are moments in your career where working with someone stands out as a highlight and this was definitely one of mine. Having such a giving and generous actor to work with, was a fantastic experience and I honestly learnt a tonne from him.</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t wait to see the finished project.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I have been filming on my first night shoot for Night&#8217;s Dream with Velocity Films. Playing the marvellously vindictive Puck in an original reinterpretation of <i>A Midsummer Night&#8217;s Dream. </i>You can see a picture above. Obviously it&#8217;s raining, hence the particularly attractive bright pink umbrella.</p>
<p>You have not been a proper actor until you have had to squelch through mud, stand in a rainstorm, or crouch in the freezing dark waiting to maim, stab or perform some sort of dangerous mock killing move on camera. Ain&#8217;t nothing like a serial killer to get your actor creativity flowing!&nbsp;</p>
<p>In this, Puck is a dangerous and flamboyant bad guy, with an ambitious yearning to be the top dog. And apparently, as discussed by the crew, bad guys are my thing.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not sure what that says about me&#8230;</p>
<p>Never judge an actor by his parts. </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Filmed with Director Alix Austin for the first time today. Alix was in the year above me at the Royal Conservatoire of Scotland and is a very talented screen director. It was wonderful to work with someone so passionate about their projects. Sharp and on point, the film looks very slick and I&#8217;m delighted to have been a part of it. I&#8217;m sure Alix and her company LoneLara Films are going to be very successful. Above is the shot on the monitor of me, Iola and Red Madrell. Unfortunately the scene was eventually cut out of the film, which was a shame, but the art of storytelling is if it&#8217;s not contributing to the story then it shouldn&#8217;t be in there. Ultimately, the story is the most important thing. It&#8217;s not about stars, or getting your moment in the spotlight because that doesn&#8217;t matter in the long term. What endures, in films, are great stories. Powerfully and economically told. I&#8217;m immensely proud to have been part of the project.</p>
